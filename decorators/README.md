## Decorators

A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function or class as input, extends or modifies its behavior, and returns it — usually without changing its actual source code.

Think of it as a “wrapper” that adds functionality around another function/class.

### Types of decorators

This is based on what they are decorating

| Type | Notes | Examples |
| Function Decorators | Most commonly used | `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, `@property`, `@lru_cache` |
